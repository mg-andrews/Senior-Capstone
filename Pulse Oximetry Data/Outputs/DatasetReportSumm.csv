bloodgas,"['patient_id', 'encounter_id', 'type', 'date', 'time', 'sample', 'ph', 'pco2', 'po2', 'so2', 'cohb', 'methb', 'thb', 'k', 'na', 'ca', 'cl', 'glucose', 'lactate', 'p50', 'cbase', 'ETCO2', 'ETO2', 'ScalcO2', 'RR', 'dev55_HR', 'dev60_HR', 'dev59_HR', 'dev64_HR', 'dev64_HR.1', 'dev71_HR', 'dev71_NBP_SYS', 'dev71_NBP_DIA', 'dev71_NBP_MEAN', 'dev71_ABP_SYS', 'dev71_ABP_DIA', 'dev71_ABP_MEAN', 'dev71_ART_SYS', 'dev71_ART_DIA', 'dev71_ART_MEAN', 'dev60_HR.1', 'dev73_HR', 'dev59_HR.1', 'dev76_HR']",The bloodgas.csv file contains blood gas measurements and data obtained at the same time as the blood gas. Each row represents the results from a single blood gas sample and clinical data from that time. These samples are linked to pulse oximeter readings and other data during the same encounter via sample_number and encounter_id.
devices,"['device_number', 'device_type']","The devices.csv file contains descriptive data about the pulse oximeters used in testing. These data will be published when available, though may not always be available and are not required for publishing data in this repository. Each row contains data for one pulse oximeter model and includes a unique device ID number and light transmission mode of the oximeter."
encounter,"['patient_id', 'encounter_id', 'encounter_date', 'age_at_encounter', 'warming', 'fitzpatrick', 'monk_fingernail', 'monk_dorsal', 'monk_palmar', 'monk_upper_arm', 'monk_forehead', 'right_ear_device', 'left_ear_device', 'forehead_device', 'finger_l1_device', 'finger_l2_device', 'finger_l3_device', 'finger_l4_device', 'finger_l5_device', 'finger_r1_device', 'finger_r2_device', 'finger_r3_device', 'finger_r4_device', 'finger_r5_device', 'finger_l1_diameter', 'finger_l2_diameter', 'finger_l3_diameter', 'finger_l4_diameter', 'finger_l5_diameter', 'finger_r1_diameter', 'finger_r2_diameter', 'finger_r3_diameter', 'finger_r4_diameter', 'finger_r5_diameter']","The encounter.csv file contains information from each controlled desaturation “breathe down” encounter or clinical patient sample.  Each row of the encounter table includes information from a single encounter (so examining a single encounter requires looking at only one row of the encounter table; this is not the case for other files).  Each encounter corresponds to one participant (i.e. each row has one participant ID).  Information about which device is used on which finger/location, finger diameter, and measurements made during the encounter are included in this file. Qualitative skin color measurements are also included here (e.g. Monk Skin Tone Scale). In clinical studies where these measurements occur at enrollment only, this data will be included at the initial encounter only. Dates in the encounter table are offset into the future by a random offset (set per participant) while attempting to preserve seasonality to de-identify the dataset. This preserves intra-participant chronology while inter-participant chronology is obscured."
patient,"['patient_id', 'site_id', 'assigned_sex', 'race', 'ethnicity']","The patients.csv file contains information about individual patients/participants.  Basic, relatively immutable information is included in this file, with each participant having one row in the participants file.  Participants are given a unique de-identified participant ID so that they can be identified between encounters (i.e. each participant may have many encounters), and to preserve privacy. Additionally, information about the site that is conducting the study is included in this file so that participants can be selected and stratified by site if desired during analysis."
pulseoximeter,"['encounter_id', 'device', 'probe_location', 'sample_number', 'saturation', 'pi']","The pulseoximeter.csv file contains pulse oximeter saturation readings for the different test devices. Each row contains one saturation reading from one pulse oximeter, corresponding to a specific controlled desaturation encounter (identified by encounter_id), and a specific blood gas (identified by sample_number)."
spectrophotometer,"['patient_id', 'encounter_id', 'group', 'date_calc', 'melanin_index', 'hb_index', 'hb_so2_index', 'hue', 'value', 'chroma', 'lab_l', 'lab_a', 'lab_b', 'km400', 'km410', 'km420', 'km430', 'km440', 'km450', 'km460', 'km470', 'km480', 'km490', 'km500', 'km510', 'km520', 'km530', 'km540', 'km550', 'km560', 'km570', 'km580', 'km590', 'km600', 'km610', 'km620', 'km630', 'km640', 'km650', 'km660', 'km670', 'km680', 'km690', 'km700']","The spectrophotometer.csv file contains quantitative skin color data. Each row represents one spectrophotometer measurement at a single anatomic site. Spectrophotometer measurements are typically taken three times at each anatomic site, and repeated at each encounter. They are linked to the encounter via encounter_id, and to the patient via patient_id. Multiple spectrophotometers may be used for each subject. Further information can be found on the OpenOximetry protocols page [9]."
