# WSU Bioengineering Class of 2026: Senior Capstone

## This is the Github Repository for the WSU Bioengineering VitalCentric Senior Capstone Project

ESFCOM Medical Students from Spokane have asked us to develop a blood pressure and oxygen saturation simulator for medical learner training in taking vital signs.
This repository contains the code for simulating healthy and diseased state blood pressure and oxygen saturation vital signs.

We have set up several different sections to cleanly categorize our code:

### BP Model Waveforms
This section has all the code pertaining to the generation of the Arterial Blood Pressure (mmHg) vs Time (s) tables for healthy and diseased states.

### Helpful Functions
This section contains functions we've used repeatedly during our senior year:
  - Function determiners for pessimistic, most likely, and expected time of task completion
